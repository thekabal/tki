We have committed a number of additional tools that are useful to development in the /vendor/bin directory.

phpcpd (https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpcpd) is a Copy/Paste Detector (CPD) for PHP code. We have not resolved
all errors it identifies yet, but are making progress towards doing so. We use it like this:
php vendor/bin/phpcpd . --exclude=templates --exclude=vendor

phpdcd (https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpdcd) is a Dead Code Detector (DCD) for PHP code. It scans a PHP project
for all declared functions and methods and reports those as being "dead code" that are not called at least once.
We have not resolved all errors it identifies yet, but are making progress towards doing so. We use it like this:
php vendor/bin/phpdcd --exclude=templates --exclude=vendor .

phpcs (https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) is PHP Code Sniffer. PHP_CodeSniffer tokenizes
PHP, JavaScript and CSS files and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards. We use it like this:
php vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=phpcs.xml . --ignore=templates,vendor,config,languages

phpmd (https://phpmd.org/) is PHP Mess Detector. It takes a given PHP source code base and looks for several potential
problems within that source. We use it like this:
php vendor/bin/phpmd . text phpmd.xml --exclude vendor/,templates/

php-cs-fixer strives to automatically correct code for specific items in the PSR standard. We do not currently use it,
but may in the future use it as a pre-commit hook.

There are other command-line options for these tools (try them!), with varying levels of usefulness to our project.
